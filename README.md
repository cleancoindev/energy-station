# Energy Station

Bancor protocol powered VET/Energy(VeThor) exchange contract.

## Concept

The Bancor Protocol enables automatic price determination and an autonomous liquidity mechanism for tokens on smart contract blockchains. In this caseï¼Œwe took advantage of the automatic price adjust mechanism from bancor protocol.We use the concept of [Relay Token](https://support.bancor.network/hc/en-us/articles/360000471472-How-do-Relay-Tokens-work-) but simplified the process of buying and selling. So the concepts of `Energy Station` are:

+ Create an bancor convert contract that connecting two tokens
+ One connector token is VET, the other one is VeThor token
+ The weight of connector token is 50%
+ No smart token concept just allow the convention between VET and VeThor token
